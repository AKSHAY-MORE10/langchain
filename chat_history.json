Perhaps you're thinking of universal *laws* in physics, philosophy, or some other area.  Could you clarify what kind of laws you're interested in?  For example, are you thinking of:\n\n* **Laws of physics?**  Like Newton's laws of motion, the laws of thermodynamics, or universal gravitation?\n* **Moral or ethical laws?**  Like the Golden Rule (\"Treat others as you want to be treated\")?\n* **Spiritual or philosophical principles?** Like the Law of Attraction or the concept of Karma?\n\nGiving me a little more context will help me understand what you're looking for."
